🚨 Bayesian Warning: Your Posterior Is Only as Good as Your Likelihood

Everyone loves Bayes' Theorem:

🎯 Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood

But here’s the truth most people skip:
👉 If you choose the wrong likelihood, you're just updating bad math with confidence.

Let’s say you’re modeling data —

Got 1s and 0s? You need Bernoulli, not Normal.

Counting customers per hour? That’s Poisson (unless variance explodes — then it's Negative Binomial).

Skewed sales revenue? You might be looking at Gamma or Log-normal, not Gaussian.

📊 I recently built a Python tool that acts like a Bayesian co-pilot:
It looks at your data (type, shape, variance, skew...)
And suggests:
✅ "This is likely Poisson"
✅ "Try Beta for proportions"
✅ "Too much variance — consider overdispersion"

Here is the  Streamlit app where you can upload a CSV and get an instant model suggestion — visualized, explained, and ready to roll.

💡 I'd love your thoughts:

What’s your go-to method for choosing a likelihood model?

Would a tool like this be helpful in your workflow?

What should it include? (Auto-detect data types? Q-Q plots? Prior recommendations?)

Let’s brainstorm. Let’s build smarter. Together.
